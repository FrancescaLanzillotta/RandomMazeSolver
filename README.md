# Random Maze Solver
This project aims to compare the performances of a maze solver using both a sequential and a parallel approach based on OpenMP library. 

To solve the maze, a certain amount of particles are moved randomly within the maze. Once a particle finds the exit, the solution is highlighted and all the other particles follow its path.
